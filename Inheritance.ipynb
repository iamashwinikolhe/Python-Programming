    "### What is Inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is the ability to ‘inherit’ features or attributes from already written classes into newer classes we make. These features and attributes are defined data structures and the functions we can perform with them, a.k.a. Methods. It promotes code reusability, which is considered one of the best industrial coding practices as it makes the codebase modular.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python inheritance, new class/es inherits from older class/es. The new class/es copies all the older class's functions and attributes without rewriting the syntax in the new class/es. These new classes are called derived classes, and old ones are called base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, inheritance is often used in biology to symbolize the transfer of genetic traits from parents to their children. Similarly, we have parent classes (Base classes) and child classes (derived classes). In Inheritance, we derive classes from other already existing classes. The existing classes are the parent/base classes from which the attributes and methods are inherited in the child classes."
